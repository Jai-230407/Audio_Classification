The Capuchin Bird Audio Classification Project by HP is an application of machine learning to classify bird vocalizations, specifically focusing on Capuchinbird calls. This project involves analyzing audio recordings to detect the presence of the species in natural environments, assisting researchers and conservationists in monitoring their populations and behaviors.

Project Objectives:
Bird Call Identification: Detect and classify Capuchinbird calls from audio data.
Conservation: Provide a scalable and automated way to monitor Capuchinbird populations in the wild.
Research Support: Enable ornithologists to gather insights into behavior, migration, and habitat use.
Dataset Characteristics:
Audio Recordings:

Typically contains environmental sounds with overlapping bird calls, other species, and background noise.
Audio files are often in formats like WAV or MP3, sampled at specific rates (e.g., 16kHz or 44.1kHz).
Labels:

Binary classification: Capuchinbird call (1) vs. No call (0).
Multi-class classification for detecting calls of other species may also be included.
Challenges:

Background noise such as wind, rain, or other animal sounds.
Overlapping calls from different species.
Variability in call patterns and loudness.
Steps to Build the Audio Classifier:
Preprocessing:

Convert audio to spectrograms (visual representations of sound).
Apply noise reduction and silence removal techniques.
Segment audio into fixed-duration chunks (e.g., 1-second windows).
Feature Extraction:

Extract features like Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs), Chroma features, or Spectral Contrast.
Use spectrograms as input for deep learning models.
Model Selection:

Traditional Machine Learning: Random Forests or SVM with features like MFCCs.
Deep Learning:
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for spectrograms.
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) or transformers for sequential data.
Evaluation:

Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC.
Use techniques like data augmentation and cross-validation for robustness.
Applications:
Wildlife Conservation: Automating population monitoring in protected areas.
Ecological Research: Understanding habitat preferences and seasonal behaviors.
Bioacoustics: Developing broader systems for identifying various animal sounds.
